Git hub is a great tool for data sharing. This allows users to share their data as public, and they could treat their almost every data versions. 
You do not have to worry about the data loosing by oberwriting the data mistakenly. Since git hub saves every versions of your commits. 
However, this tool is not for everyone, especially for who are not familier with computer well. 
Since, it is required to use terminal and users use comand keys for dealing with github space. 
Also, one huge downside of this tool is it's limitation of each data size. Github allows only small size of data. 
Usually 100 MB or smaller. GitHub is not the option when you are dealing with biddata.
